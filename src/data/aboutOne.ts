  description:
    "At Enroute Trips, we believe travel is more than just visiting places - it’s about collecting moments, building connections, and discovering new sides of yourself. Born from the legacy of the well-known Enroute Tour N Travel, Enroute Trips was created by a group of dynamic minds who were crazy about travel and shared one simple idea - why not build a community of befikre travellers who explore freely and fearlessly. That’s how we started curating budget friendly weekend getaways. Now we design thoughtfully designed trips for young explorers, friend groups, couples, and families who want meaningful experiences without the stress of planning. From the serene landscapes of Chopta and Tirthan Valley to the deserts of Jaisalmer and the charm of Udaipur, we curate unforgettable weekend escapes to some of the most loved destinations including Chakrata, Auli, Spiti Valley, and many more.",
