      text: "I recently booked my Spiti Valley tour with Enroute Trips and it was a truly memorable experience. From the start, their team was responsive and clear with all itinerary details. Once on the road, the logistics were smooth and well organised, which made the long drives through rugged mountain terrain comfortable. Every stop on the route felt thoughtfully planned so we could enjoy key sights without feeling rushed. Local accommodations were cosy and gave us a genuine feel for life in the valley. The guides and drivers were friendly, knowledgeable, and took extra care to keep us safe at high altitudes. Overall, the trip was one of the best I’ve done, and I would recommend Enroute Trips to anyone looking for a hassle-free, well-supported adventure in Spiti Valley.",

We didn’t have to worry about a single thing—pickups were on time, the itinerary was perfectly paced, and the hotel stays in the city were comfortable and well-located. A huge shoutout to our trip coordinator for keeping everyone energized and ensuring we covered every spot from the Fort to Gadisar Lake without feeling rushed. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a stress-free Rajasthan experience!",
